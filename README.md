# XMLUI Start

Install XMLUI and run your first app.

## 🪟 Installing on Windows

1. **Download the starter kit ZIP**  
   [Download starter-kit-windows.zip](https://github.com/JonUdell/xmlui-start/releases/download/v0.0.1/starter-kit-windows.zip)

2. **Extract the ZIP**  
   - After the download completes, click the **folder icon** next to the file in your browser to open it in File Explorer  
   - Click **"Extract all"** in the toolbar  
   - Choose a location (or accept the default) and click **Extract**

3. **Open the extracted folder in Terminal**  
   - Right-click inside the extracted folder (not on a file)  
   - Choose **"Open in Terminal"**

4. **Run the installer**  
   In the terminal window that appears, type:

   ```cmd
   install-windows.bat
   ```

   This will:
   - Download the XMLUI helper server
   - Start it in the background
   - Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

> 💡 **Note:** If you double-click `install-windows.bat` directly, Windows may show a “Windows protected your PC” warning. Running from the terminal avoids that hassle.
